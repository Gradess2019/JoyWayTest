UE version: 4.26 source
VR headset: Oculus Rift

I totally recommend test the app using batch files:
- client_vr.bat - starts a client in VR mode, map - JoyWayMap1
- server.bat - starts a server, map - JoyWayMap1

Additional action mappings:
O - connect to the started server
P - possess DefaultPawn (keymap WASD + Mouse)
R - commit a suicide (player will die, and then respawn)
